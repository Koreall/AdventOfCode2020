# AdventOfCode2020

This is the root folder of my Advent of Code (edition 2020) solutions, using **Python3**. 

As well as the front-end allowing you to download your own inputs and solve them without interaction.

A time may come when I'll add some way to visualize what's happening to give it more life (but it may never see the light).

## Use of front-end (menu.py)

TODO

## Incompleteness

This contains my python solutions up to the 7th day (which is the latest available day at the time). If a solution is absent, try to come back later (or open an issue).

You're also welcome to open an issue to discuss my implementation, or any other subject.

## How to use without frontend

Download your input, and change the file path in the corresponding algorithm. Then start the algorithm using Python3 and the results should get printed.
